// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// planning
// analysis of requirements
// design
// implementation
// Testing & Integration 
// maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Developers and product managers gather data and input from clients and users and other market sources to create documentation. This documentation outlines pitfalls, inconviences, pain points, and other issues with current software. "
const design = "Developers can implement first principles or analogy techniques when approaching solutions. They begin brainstorming structure and function of proposed products."
const implementation = "Coding of the product begins and developers can work together and use programming tools to build the product, based off of agreed documentation selected during the previous phase. "
const testingAndIntegration = "Developers and Quality Assurance teams begin running the code and testing for inconstistincies, errors, and general functionality in accordance to previous stages. They then begin shipping the product to customers."
const maintenance = "Long term and/or high volume usage with user feedback allows developers to iron out small creases in the code over time, improving the product."
